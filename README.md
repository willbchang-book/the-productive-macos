# Introduction

- **Purpose**: This is a complete guide of configuring the productive MacOS and using it smoothly. 
- **Who should Read**: General Users, Programmers, *Writers, and Composers*.

Configurations will be explained as much as I can.

**For Programmers**: All scripts are stored in [willbchang/macos](https://github.com/willbchang/macos). It usually comes with descriptions and possible values, sometimes with how I discovered/solved it. Please read it through before running it to prevent unexpected things which also helps you understand MacOS better.

### System Preferences

They can be enabled/disabled in two ways -- [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) and [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) for general users and hackers, several features can only be enabled/disabled from CLI.

Most of them are in `System Preferences` and stored as plist files in `~/Library/Preferences/`.

I'll help you:

- Reorganize the file structure, you can find the file/folder in 3 steps.
